Lately, I’ve started writing a newsletter, so I’ve been subscribing to a wide range of news sources. Most websites still offer RSS feeds, which is super helpful, but some don’t. I’ve been using Inoreader for a long time, and while it’s great, it charges extra to follow sites without RSS feeds.

I tried a few other services that claim to generate RSS feeds from any website, but after two months of testing, I never received a single update.

That’s when I came across [RSS.app](https://rss.app/), and it completely changed the game. It’s incredibly easy to use and actually works! This [step-by-step guide](https://rss.app/blog/how-to-follow-websites-that-don-t-have-rss-feeds-LsELgP) walks you through how to follow websites without RSS feeds. Highly recommended if you’re curating content for a newsletter or just want a better way to stay informed.
